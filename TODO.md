* Furuset: new inventory git repo
* I'd like the inventory gir repo to include the filenames of all the photos (backup of the photos are done separately, but we need the file listings to roll out the photos to the correct places)
* Currently used for "Solveig" and "Furuset".
* IDs should be better thought through
* Furuset: reintegrate the new script and ensure the existing structure does not break too much
* Solveig: take photos
* When the Solveig and Furuset inventory systems look OK, we should make a demo site and make a 1.0-release
* Consider scrapping the markdown file
